this is a directory with a few snippets of working with the pre-processor. There have been other projects where as a cohort we used the specific qualities of processing files, compiling, assembling and linking, and there are instances we have used all these concepts being applied in the work that is to be done in C programming. Especially with the prototypes and header files a lot of work has been done with the preprocessor. So, I believe given the work done already, this is a start to a new approach to more programming in C for the sake of awareness of what's possible.
