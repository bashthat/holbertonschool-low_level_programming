In this project, there is the common theme of working with prototypes developed independently in a MAIN_H function in a main.h file, that is a header file to be used in the main.c and the file being written and worked on for the process of answering every question as needed. 
The prototype will serve the basics of C progrimming from functions and arithmatic. basic output of multliplication, adding, counting 0-9, a-z, or A-Z and recognizing certain qaulities every question asks for to print a certain answer through the printf function.
happy coding
