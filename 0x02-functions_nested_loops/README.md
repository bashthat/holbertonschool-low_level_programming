this is an interesting learning curve on how to compile files developing a more personal standard for prototypes in the putchar function.

so far, there is a new aspect to compiling code. using the source of developing prototypes in a main.h and main.c file, to test and run code which is what will be happening when working with holbertonschool.

its one of those programming curveballs, getting from compiling simple code to printf() developing if, while, until loops to display the alphabet and etc.

but now, with putchar, the compilation process starts with gcc... so, gcc <mainfile/headerfile> <Cprogram> .. a lot of changes for sure. but. code, is code, is code... time to code :)
